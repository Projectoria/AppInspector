App Inspector
=============

Inspect the detailed properties of all apps installed on your device.
Those properties are available to Android's internal PackageManager,
usually many of them are not exposed by system's default user
interface (such as Version code, Target SDK Version, etc).

Useful for developers and curious users alike.
